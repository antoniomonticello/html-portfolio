<h1>The Best Movies According to Tony</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Need for Speed</h3>
<p>This is a very thrilling, action packed movie. There are a ton of cool cars, exhilarating races, and emotional moments that even the viewer will be struck to the heart with.</p>

<h3>Deadpool</h3>
<p>This is by far one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.
There are fight scenes, comedic scenes, and some gore scenes.
The role is perfectly played by Ryan Reynolds nd could not picture it any other way.</p>

<h3>After (2019)</h3>
<p>This movie is part of a romance series on netflix.
The main character Hardin is a not so caring tough guy in the start.
He soon realizes after a bet he is falling in love with the co star and is thrown into a whirlwind of emotions.
The movie displays so many different emotion the viewer can feel and truly left me wanting more.</p>
